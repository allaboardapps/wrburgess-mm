Different pay for different locales
READMORE

Merit: Is it unfair, on principal, to pay people at the same firm different amounts for the same work/productivity? This seems to be your focus.

Competitive: Will the employees that are getting paid less leave to find firms that pay everyone the same, regardless of location? This is a risk to your team's productivity.

Legal: Can an argument be made that it's illegal (like EEOC-related) to pay people differently for same work, different location? (I have no idea)

Strategically: Firms outsource work to different contractors and teams all the time to have work done at different levels of labor costs. In the case of full-time employees, I'm not sure how this fits for how your firm manages its workforce.

Personally, I look at folks on my teams and try to compensate based on what they mean to the team and the cost of losing them. I don't care about their location, whatsoever, unless their location factors into their productivity. I don't find that HR departments care about much except for numbers and the means to meet budgets.
